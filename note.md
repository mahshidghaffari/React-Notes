# INSTALLATION
*before installation make sure that node.js is in the latest version
## Create new project
### `npm create-react-app my-app`

## Start the project
### `npm start`


## all dependency that you have to learn
- check for JSX file
- CSS [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- react 16 
- web socket protocol (socket to client)

## Architecture 
- public/index.html   ==> define root 
- src/index.js        ==> get the root / Also define the main app in here 
- src/app.js          ==>  this the place every thing started. in order to use it in JSX version change app.js to App.jsx/
maybe you get error after changing the type of app so ==>  also go to index.js and change the import or rerun the app again "npm start"
